{"name":"Memtester-mac","body":"## What's MemTester - Mac?\r\n\r\nIt's a native Cocoa port of a game a friend of mine made a while ago. The game was written in Java and was therefore terrible (jk). MemTester - Mac is just a weekend project really. MemTester's a little memory testing game. It'll present you with a series of letters, numbers or characters depending on the difficulty and you'll have to memorise them and then re-enter them. Simple.\r\n\r\n## What's completed in MemTester - Mac?\r\n\r\nMost of the features of the original Java version are now available in MemTester - Mac. An easy, medium & hard difficulty is available and high score saving has been implemented, complete with a high scores table (of course). The only feature which hasn't been implemented is a cheat mode, simply because I haven't found a nice way to integrate it with the user interface (all the code is there though). \r\n\r\nMemTester - Mac has started to differ a bit from the original Java version and there's quite a few things that MemTester - Mac does differently. \r\n\r\n## Where's The Original Version of MemTester?\r\n\r\nMy friend has it on a GoogleCode page. There's a desktop version (that needs Java) and an Android version too. There's also source code.\r\n\r\n[MemTester (Original)](https://code.google.com/p/mem-tester/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMy friend has it under the GNU GPL v3 license. Does that mean I have to?
