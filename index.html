        <h2>What's MemTester - Mac?</h2>

<p>It's a native Cocoa port of a game a friend of mine made a while ago. The game was written in Java and was therefore terrible (jk). MemTester - Mac is just a weekend project really. MemTester's a little memory testing game. It'll present you with a series of letters, numbers or characters depending on the difficulty and you'll have to memorise them and then re-enter them. Simple.</p>

<h2>What's completed in MemTester - Mac?</h2>

<p>Most of the features of the original Java version are now available in MemTester - Mac. An easy, medium &amp; hard difficulty is available and high score saving has been implemented, complete with a high scores table (of course). The only feature which hasn't been implemented is a cheat mode, simply because I haven't found a nice way to integrate it with the user interface (all the code is there though). </p>

<p>MemTester - Mac has started to differ a bit from the original Java version and there's quite a few things that MemTester - Mac does differently. </p>

<h2>Where's The Original Version of MemTester?</h2>

<p>My friend has it on a GoogleCode page. There's a desktop version (that needs Java) and an Android version too. There's also source code.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>My friend has it under the GNU GPL v3 license. Does that mean I have to? </p>
